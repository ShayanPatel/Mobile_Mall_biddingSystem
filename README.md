# Mobile_Mall_biddingSystem
This project focuses on building a database management system aimed at implementing a bidding architecture for mobile on sale. 
This architecture further ensures the privacy of a seller whose information would only be displayed after, the seller accepts a bid, an online buyer has made.
Further modifications to the code can also be done where the User interface could be improved, and a further option of catering and supporting the buyers and sellers in case any problems arise.
